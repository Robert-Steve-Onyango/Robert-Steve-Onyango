## About Me
I am a Data Science undergrad with aspirations of becoming a Data Engineer. I am AWS Certified and have several Coursera certificates in Foundations of Data and Data Analysis. I enjoy working on side projects and gigs, including Django App Development, Streamlit, and Virtual Assistance for Data Analysts.
